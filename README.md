# Hello World: The Start of My Developer Journey

<!-- TODO Add a table to the top that is a quick reference for some of the top or featured projects/assignemnts. such as the more advanced previews -->

Welcome to my collection of projects and assignments from my associates degree in Software Development at the College of Western Idaho (CWI)! This repository captures the early stages of my journey, where I began exploring programming, web development, and the fundamentals of software.

## About This Repository

This is a snapshot of my "Hello, World!" phase—those first exciting steps into coding where every new concept felt like a gateway to endless possibilities. Most of the work here is focused on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, showcasing the foundational skills I built while learning the basics of:
- Structuring web pages with HTML
- Adding style and design with CSS
- Making pages interactive with vanilla JavaScript

## What's Inside

Here’s what you’ll find:
- **HTML Projects**: Basic web pages demonstrating structure and content.
- **CSS Work**: Experiments with layouts, colors, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript Scripts**: Simple interactive features and exercises, such as loops, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Each project reflects my progress as I practiced and applied new concepts, building confidence with every assignment.
